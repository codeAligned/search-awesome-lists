Awesome

     Curated list of awesome visual regression testing resources.

   Regression testing is a type of software testing which verifies that
   software which was previously developed and tested still performs the
   same way after it was changed or interfaced with other software. The
   purpose of regression testing is to ensure that changes to the software
   have not introduced new faults.

Foreword

   This is intended to be an incomplete list of resources about visual
   regression testing. It is not tailored to a specific area or role
   (Developer/QA/UX-Designer). Note that this is for all areas of
   regression software testing after the code in question is written. For
   a awesome list on general software testing see e.g.
   [https://github.com/TheJambo/awesome-testing]awsome-testing.

   Finally, I'm sure everyone who reads this list has one thing they want
   to add. Please read the
   [https://github.com/TheJambo/awesome-testing/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.m
   d]How to Contribute page and Feel free to add to the list!!. If you
   think this is helpful Please give a Star *.
