     A Curated List of Ruby Machine Learning Links and Resources

   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning]Machine Learning is a
   field of
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_science]Computational
   Science - often nested under
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence]AI research -
   with many practical applications due to the ability of resulting
   algorithms to systematically implement a specific solution without
   explicit programmer's instructions. Obviously many algorithms need a
   definition of
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering]features to look at
   or a biggish [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_set]training set of
   data to derive the solution from.

   This curated list comprises
   [https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md]awesome
   libraries, data sources, tutorials and presentations about
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning]Machine Learning
   utilizing the [https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/]Ruby programming language.

   A lot of useful resources on this list come from the development by
   [https://github.com/sciruby]The Ruby Science Foundation, our
   [https://github.com/arbox/machine-learning-with-ruby/graphs/contributor
   s]contributors and our own day to day work on various ML applications.

Wait but why?

   There are a lot of software lists with ML related tools. There are a
   couple of lists with Ruby related projects. There are no lists of only
   working and tested software with documented scope. We'll try to make
   one!

   What is awesome? Awesome are documented, maintained and focused tools.

   Can something turn not awesome at a point? Yes! Abandoned projects with
   broken dependencies aren't awesome any more! They leave this list.
