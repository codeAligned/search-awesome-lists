Introduction

   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval]Information
   Retrieval involves finding relevant information for user queries,
   ranging from simple domain of database search to complicated aspects of
   web search (Eg - Google, Bing, Yahoo). Currently, researchers are
   developing algorithms to address
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_needs]Information Need of
   user(s), by maximizing
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevance_(information_retrieval)]User
   and Topic Relevance of retrieved results, while minimizing
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_overload]Information
   Overload and retrieval time.
