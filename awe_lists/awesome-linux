Distributions

   Distributions are organized into three different categories: for
   beginners, for intermediate users and for advanced users. In those
   categories, the distributions are organized in the alphabetical order.

Beginners

elementary OS

     elementary OS is an Ubuntu-based desktop distribution. Some of its
     more interesting features include a custom desktop environment
     called Pantheon and many custom apps including Photos, Music,
     Videos, Calendar, Terminal, Files, and more. It also comes with some
     familiar apps like the Epiphany web browser and a fork of Geary
     mail.

   Latest version: elementary OS Loki (0.4.1)

   Default Desktop Environment: Pantheon

Fedora

     Fedora (formerly Fedora Core) is a Linux distribution developed by
     the community-supported Fedora Project and owned by Red Hat. Fedora
     contains software distributed under a free and open-source license
     and aims to be on the leading edge of such technologies. Fedora has
     a reputation for focusing on innovation, integrating new
     technologies early on and working closely with upstream Linux
     communities. The default desktop in Fedora is the GNOME desktop
     environment and the default interface is the GNOME Shell. Other
     desktop environments, including KDE, Xfce, LXDE, MATE and Cinnamon,
     are available. Fedora Project also distributes custom variations of
     Fedora called Fedora spins. These are built with specific sets of
     software packages, offering alternative desktop environments or
     targeting specific interests such as gaming, security, design,
     scientific computing and robotics.

   Latest version: Fedora Twenty Seven (27)

   Default Desktop Environment: GNOME

Linux Mint

     Linux Mint is an Ubuntu-based distribution whose goal is to provide
     a more complete out-of-the-box experience by including browser
     plugins, support for DVD playback, Java and other components. It
     also adds a custom desktop and menus, several unique configuration
     tools, and a web-based package installation interface. Linux Mint is
     compatible with Ubuntu software repositories.

   Latest version: Linux Mint Sonya (18.2)

   Default Desktop Environment: Cinnamon and MATE

Ubuntu

     Ubuntu is a complete desktop Linux operating system, freely
     available with both community and professional support. The Ubuntu
     community is built on the ideas enshrined in the Ubuntu Manifesto:
     that software should be available free of charge, that software
     tools should be usable by people in their local language and despite
     any disabilities, and that people should have the freedom to
     customise and alter their software in whatever way they see fit.
     "Ubuntu" is an ancient African word, meaning "humanity to others".
     The Ubuntu distribution brings the spirit of Ubuntu to the software
     world.

   Latest version: Ubuntu 17.10

Intermediate

CentOS

     CentOS as a group is a community of open source contributors and
     users. Typical CentOS users are organisations and individuals that
     do not need strong commercial support in order to achieve successful
     operation. CentOS is 100% compatible rebuild of the Red Hat
     Enterprise Linux, in full compliance with Red Hat's redistribution
     requirements. CentOS is for people who need an enterprise class
     operating system stability without the cost of certification and
     support.

   Latest version: CentOS 7.1611

   Default Desktop Environment: GNOME

Debian GNU/Linux

     The Debian Project is an association of individuals who have made
     common cause to create a free operating system. This operating
     system is called Debian. Debian systems currently use the Linux
     kernel. Linux is a completely free piece of software started by
     Linus Torvalds and supported by thousands of programmers worldwide.
     Of course, the thing that people want is application software:
     programs to help them get what they want to do done, from editing
     documents to running a business to playing games to writing more
     software. Debian comes with over 50,000 packages (precompiled
     software that is bundled up in a nice format for easy installation
     on your machine) - all of it free. It's a bit like a tower. At the
     base is the kernel. On top of that are all the basic tools. Next is
     all the software that you run on the computer. At the top of the
     tower is Debian -- carefully organizing and fitting everything so it
     all works together.

   Latest version: Debian Stretch (9.1)

   Default Desktop Environment: GNOME

Mageia

     Mageia is a fork of Mandriva Linux formed in September 2010 by
     former employees and contributors to the popular French Linux
     distribution. Unlike Mandriva, which is a commercial entity, the
     Mageia project is a community project and a non-profit organisation
     whose goal is to develop a free Linux-based operating system.

   Latest version: Mageia 6

   Default Desktop Environment: KDE

Manjaro

     Manjaro Linux is a fast, user-friendly, desktop-oriented operating
     system based on Arch Linux. Key features include intuitive
     installation process, automatic hardware detection, stable
     rolling-release model, ability to install multiple kernels, special
     Bash scripts for managing graphics drivers and extensive desktop
     configurability. Manjaro Linux offers Xfce as the core desktop
     options, as well as a minimalist Net edition for more advanced
     users. Community-supported GNOME 3/Cinnamon and KDE flavours are
     available. Users also benefit from the supportive and vibrant
     Manjaro community forum.

openSUSE

     The openSUSE project is a community program sponsored by SUSE Linux
     and other companies. Promoting the use of Linux everywhere, this
     program provides free, easy access to openSUSE, a complete Linux
     distribution. The openSUSE project has three main goals: make
     openSUSE the easiest Linux for anyone to obtain and the most widely
     used Linux distribution; leverage open source collaboration to make
     openSUSE the world's most usable Linux distribution and desktop
     environment for new and experienced Linux users; dramatically
     simplify and open the development and packaging processes to make
     openSUSE the platform of choice for Linux developers and software
     vendors.

Advanced

Arch Linux

     Arch Linux is an independently developed, i686- and x86_64-optimised
     Linux distribution targeted at competent Linux users. It uses
     'pacman', its home-grown package manager, to provide updates to the
     latest software applications with full dependency tracking.
     Operating on a rolling release system, Arch can be installed from a
     CD image or via an FTP server. The default install provides a solid
     base that enables users to create a custom installation. In
     addition, the Arch Build System (ABS) provides a way to easily build
     new packages, modify the configuration of stock packages, and share
     these packages with other users via the Arch Linux user repository.

   Latest version: Not applicable (Rolling Release system)

   Default Desktop Environment: Not applicable (there's no default Desktop
   environment)

Special Purpose

CoreOS

   Specialty: Clusters

     CoreOS is a Linux-based operating system for servers. Built from the
     ground up and designed primarily for the modern data centre, CoreOS
     provides specialist tools for making the system secure, reliable and
     up-to-date. Some of the more interesting features of the
     distribution include reliable updates and patches via FastPatch, a
     dashboard for managing rolling updates via CoreUpdate, a docker for
     packaging applications, as well as support for bare metal and many
     cloud providers.

Kali Linux

   Specialty: Penetration testing

     Kali Linux (formerly known as BackTrack) is a Debian-based
     distribution with a collection of security and forensics tools. It
     features timely security updates, support for the ARM architecture,
     a choice of four popular desktop environments, and seamless upgrades
     to newer versions.

Puppy Linux

   Specialty: Low system requirements

     Puppy Linux is yet another Linux distribution. What's different here
     is that Puppy is extraordinarily small, yet quite full-featured.
     Puppy boots into a ramdisk and, unlike live CD distributions that
     have to keep pulling stuff off the CD, it loads into RAM. This means
     that all applications start in the blink of an eye and respond to
     user input instantly. Puppy Linux has the ability to boot off a
     flash card or any USB memory device, CDROM, Zip disk or LS/120/240
     Superdisk, floppy disks, internal hard drive. It can even use a
     multisession formatted CD-RW/DVD-RW to save everything back to the
     CD/DVD with no hard drive required at all.

Ubuntu Studio

   Specialty: Multimedia creation

     Ubuntu Studio is a variant of Ubuntu aimed at the GNU/Linux audio,
     video and graphic enthusiast as well as professional. The
     distribution provides a collection of open-source applications
     available for multimedia creation.
