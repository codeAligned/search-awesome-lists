Protocols and Networks

Physical layer

802.15.4 (IEEE)

   IEEE 802.15.4 is a standard which specifies the physical layer and
   media access control for low-rate wireless personal area networks
   (LR-WPANs). It is maintained by the IEEE 802.15 working group, which
   has defined it in 2003. It is the basis for the ZigBee, ISA100.11a,
   WirelessHART, and MiWi specifications, each of which further extends
   the standard by developing the upper layers which are not defined in
   IEEE 802.15.4. Alternatively, it can be used with 6LoWPAN and standard
   Internet protocols to build a wireless embedded Internet. -
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4]Wikipedia

     IEEE standard 802.15.4 intends to offer the fundamental lower
     network layers of a type of wireless personal area network (WPAN)
     which focuses on low-cost, low-speed ubiquitous communication
     between devices. It can be contrasted with other approaches, such as
     Wi-Fi, which offer more bandwidth and require more power. The
     emphasis is on very low cost communication of nearby devices with
     little to no underlying infrastructure, intending to exploit this to
     lower power consumption even more.

Bluetooth (Bluetooth Special Interest Group)

   Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard for exchanging data over
   short distances (using short-wavelength UHF radio waves in the ISM band
   from 2.4 to 2.485 GHz) from fixed and mobile devices, and building
   personal area networks (PANs). Invented by telecom vendor Ericsson in
   1994, it was originally conceived as a wireless alternative to RS-232
   data cables. It can connect several devices, overcoming problems of
   synchronization. - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth]Wikipedia

     Bluetooth is managed by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG),
     which has more than 25,000 member companies in the areas of
     telecommunication, computing, networking, and consumer electronics.

Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth Special Interest Group)

   Bluetooth low energy (Bluetooth LE, BLE, marketed as Bluetooth Smart)
   is a wireless personal area network technology designed and marketed by
   the Bluetooth Special Interest Group aimed at novel applications in the
   healthcare, fitness, beacons, security, and home entertainment
   industries. -

     Compared to Classic Bluetooth, Bluetooth Smart is intended to
     provide considerably reduced power consumption and cost while
     maintaining a similar communication range. The Bluetooth SIG
     predicts that by 2018 more than 90 percent of Bluetooth-enabled
     smartphones will support Bluetooth Smart.

     the security and privacy mobile network features, such as support
     for user identity confidentiality, entity authentication,
     confidentiality, data integrity, and mobile equipment
     identification.

LoRaWAN (LoRa Alliance)

   A LoRaWAN wide area network allows low bit rate communication from and
   to connected objects, thus participating to Internet of Things,
   machine-to-machine M2M, and smart city. -
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRaWAN]Wikipedia

     This technology is standardized by the LoRa Alliance. It was
     initially developed by Cycleo, which was acquired by Semtech in
     2012. LoRaWAN is an acronym for Long Range Wide-area network.

NB-IoT (3GPP)

   NarrowBand IoT (NB-IoT) is a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) radio
   technology standard that has been developed to enable a wide range of
   devices and services to be connected using cellular telecommunications
   bands. - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NarrowBand_IOT]Wikipedia

     NB-IoT is a narrowband radio technology designed for the Internet of
     Things (IoT), and is one of a range of Mobile IoT (MIoT)
     technologies standardized by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project
     (3GPP).

Sigfox (Sigfox)

   Sigfox is a French firm that builds wireless networks to connect
   low-energy objects such as electricity meters, smart watches, and
   washing machines, which need to be continuously on and emitting small
   amounts of data. Its infrastructure is intended to be a contribution to
   what is known as the Internet of Things (IoT). -
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigfox]Wikipedia

     SIGFOX describes itself as "the first and only company providing
     global cellular connectivity for the Internet of Things." Its
     infrastructure is "completely independent of existing networks, such
     as telecommunications networks." SIGFOX seeks to provide the means
     for the "deployment of billions of objects and thousands of new
     uses" with the long-term goal of "having petabytes of data produced
     by everyday objects".

Wi-Fi (Wi-Fi Alliance)

   Wi-Fi (or WiFi) is a local area wireless computer networking technology
   that allows electronic devices to network, mainly using the 2.4
   gigahertz (12 cm) UHF and 5 gigahertz (6 cm) SHF ISM radio bands. -
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi]Wikipedia

     The Wi-Fi Alliance defines Wi-Fi as any "wireless local area
     network" (WLAN) product based on the Institute of Electrical and
     Electronics Engineers' (IEEE) 802.11 standards.[1] However, the term
     "Wi-Fi" is used in general English as a synonym for "WLAN" since
     most modern WLANs are based on these standards. "Wi-Fi" is a
     trademark of the Wi-Fi Alliance. The "Wi-Fi Certified" trademark can
     only be used by Wi-Fi products that successfully complete Wi-Fi
     Alliance interoperability certification testing.

Network / Transport layer

6LowPan (IETF)

   6LoWPAN is an acronym of IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area
   Networks. 6LoWPAN is the name of a concluded working group in the
   Internet area of the IETF. -
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6LoWPAN]Wikipedia

     The 6LoWPAN concept originated from the idea that "the Internet
     Protocol could and should be applied even to the smallest
     devices,"and that low-power devices with limited processing
     capabilities should be able to participate in the Internet of
     Things. The 6LoWPAN group has defined encapsulation and header
     compression mechanisms that allow IPv6 packets to be sent and
     received over IEEE 802.15.4 based networks. IPv4 and IPv6 are the
     work horses for data delivery for local-area networks, metropolitan
     area networks, and wide-area networks such as the Internet.
     Likewise, IEEE 802.15.4 devices provide sensing
     communication-ability in the wireless domain. The inherent natures
     of the two networks though, are different.

Thread (Thread Group)

   Thread is an IPv6 based protocol for "smart" household devices to
   communicate on a network.

     In July 2014 Google Inc's Nest Labs announced a working group with
     the companies Samsung, ARM Holdings, Freescale, Silicon Labs, Big
     Ass Fans and the lock company Yale in an attempt to have Thread
     become the industry standard by providing Thread certification for
     products. Other protocols currently in use include ZigBee and
     Bluetooth Smart. Thread uses 6LoWPAN, which in turn uses the IEEE
     802.15.4 wireless protocol with mesh communication, as does ZigBee
     and other systems. Thread however is IP-addressable, with cloud
     access and AES encryption. It supports over 250 devices on a
     network.

ZigBee (ZigBee Alliance)

   ZigBee is a IEEE 802.15.4-based specification for a suite of high-level
   communication protocols used to create personal area networks with
   small, low-power digital radios. -
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZigBee]Wikipedia

     The technology defined by the ZigBee specification is intended to be
     simpler and less expensive than other wireless personal area
     networks (WPANs), such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. Applications include
     wireless light switches, electrical meters with in-home-displays,
     traffic management systems, and other consumer and industrial
     equipment that requires short-range low-rate wireless data transfer.

Z-Wave (Z-Wave Alliance)

   Z-Wave is a wireless communications specification designed to allow
   devices in the home (lighting, access controls, entertainment systems
   and household appliances, for example) to communicate with one another
   for the purposes of home automation. -
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-Wave]Wikipedia

     Z-Wave technology minimizes power consumption so that it is suitable
     for battery-operated devices. Z-Wave is designed to provide,
     reliable, low-latency transmission of small data packets at data
     rates up to 100kbit/s, unlike Wi-Fi and other IEEE 802.11-based
     wireless LAN systems that are designed primarily for high data
     rates. Z-Wave operates in the sub-gigahertz frequency range, around
     900 MHz.

Application layer

CoAP (IETF)

   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a software protocol intended
   to be used in very simple electronics devices that allows them to
   communicate interactively over the Internet. -
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_Application_Protocol]Wikiped
   ia

     CoAP is particularly targeted for small low power sensors, switches,
     valves and similar components that need to be controlled or
     supervised remotely, through standard Internet networks. CoAP is an
     application layer protocol that is intended for use in
     resource-constrained internet devices, such as WSN nodes.

DTLS (IETF)

   The Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) communications protocol
   provides communications security for datagram protocols. -
   [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datagram_Transport_Layer_Security]Wikipe
   dia

     DTLS allows datagram-based applications to communicate in a way that
     is designed[by whom?] to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or
     message forgery. The DTLS protocol is based on the stream-oriented
     Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol and is intended to provide
     similar security guarantees.

Eddystone (Google)

   Eddystone is a beacon technology profile released by Google in July
   2015. The open source, cross-platform software gives users location and
   proximity data via Bluetooth low-energy beacon format. -
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddystone_(Google)]Wikipedia

     Though similar to the iBeacon released by Apple in 2013, Eddystone
     works on both Android and iOS, whereas iBeacon is limited to iOS
     platforms. A practical application of both softwares is that
     business owners can target potential customers based on the location
     of their smartphones in real time.

HTTP (IETF)

   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for
   distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the
   foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. -
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol]Wikipedia

     The standards development of HTTP was coordinated by the Internet
     Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium
     (W3C), culminating in the publication of a series of Requests for
     Comments (RFCs). The first definition of HTTP/1.1, the version of
     HTTP in common use, occurred in RFC 2068 in 1997, although this was
     obsoleted by RFC 2616 in 1999.

iBeacon (Apple)

   iBeacon is a protocol standardized by Apple and introduced at the Apple
   Worldwide Developers Conference in 2013. -
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBeacon]Wikipedia

     iBeacon uses Bluetooth low energy proximity sensing to transmit a
     universally unique identifier picked up by a compatible app or
     operating system. The identifier can be used to determine the
     device's physical location, track customers, or trigger a
     location-based action on the device such as a check-in on social
     media or a push notification.

MQTT (IBM)

   MQTT (formerly MQ Telemetry Transport) is a publish-subscribe based
   "light weight" messaging protocol for use on top of the TCP/IP
   protocol. It is designed for connections with remote locations where a
   "small code footprint" is required or the network bandwidth is limited.
   - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT]Wikipedia

     The publish-subscribe messaging pattern requires a message broker.
     The broker is responsible for distributing messages to interested
     clients based on the topic of a message. Andy Stanford-Clark and
     Arlen Nipper of Cirrus Link Solutions authored the first version of
     the protocol in 1999.

STOMP

   Simple (or Streaming) Text Oriented Message Protocol (STOMP), formerly
   known as TTMP, is a simple text-based protocol, designed for working
   with message-oriented middleware (MOM). -
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_Text_Oriented_Messaging_Protoc
   ol]Wikipedia

     STOMP provides an interoperable wire format that allows STOMP
     clients to talk with any message broker supporting the protocol. It
     is thus language-agnostic, meaning a broker developed for one
     programming language or platform can receive communications from
     client software developed in another language.

Websocket

   WebSocket is a protocol providing full-duplex communication channels
   over a single TCP connection. -
   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket]Wikipedia

     WebSocket is designed to be implemented in web browsers and web
     servers, but it can be used by any client or server application. The
     WebSocket Protocol is an independent TCP-based protocol. The
     WebSocket protocol makes more interaction between a browser and a
     website possible, facilitating live content and the creation of
     real-time games. This is made possible by providing a standardized
     way for the server to send content to the browser without being
     solicited by the client, and allowing for messages to be passed back
     and forth while keeping the connection open.

XMPP (IETF)

   Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is a communications
   protocol for message-oriented middleware based on XML (Extensible
   Markup Language). - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP]Wikipedia

     It enables the near-real-time exchange of structured yet extensible
     data between any two or more network entities. Designed to be
     extensible, the protocol has also been used for publish-subscribe
     systems, signalling for VoIP, video, file transfer, gaming, Internet
     of Things (IoT) applications such as the smart grid, and social
     networking services.
