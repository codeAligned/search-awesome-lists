About

   [http://sass-lang.com/]Sass is an extension of CSS that adds power and
   elegance to the basic language. It allows you to use variables, nested
   rules, mixins, inline imports, and more, all with a fully
   CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets
   well-organized, and get small stylesheets up and running quickly.

   Sass has two syntaxes. The new main syntax (as of Sass 3) is known as
   "SCSS" (for "Sassy CSS"), and is a superset of CSS's syntax. This means
   that every valid CSS stylesheet is valid SCSS as well. SCSS files use
   the extension .scss.

   The second, older syntax is known as the indented syntax (or just
   "Sass"). Inspired by Haml's terseness, it's intended for people who
   prefer conciseness over similarity to CSS. Instead of brackets and
   semicolons, it uses the indentation of lines to specify blocks.
   Although no longer the primary syntax, the indented syntax will
   continue to be supported. Files in the indented syntax use the
   extension .sass.
