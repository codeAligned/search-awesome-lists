Standalone Code Points

     * The code points of the Unicode blocks
       [https://codepoints.net/box_drawing]Box Drawing (U+2500 to U+257F)
       and [https://codepoints.net/block_elements]Block Elements (U+2580
       to U+259F) cover most of your monospace command-line visualization
       needs.
  ­-------®
  |Unicode|
  |rules! |
  °+-----+¯

     * [https://codepoints.net/U+2E2E]U+2E2E REVERSED QUESTION MARK - the
       "irony mark" to express irony/sarcasm. A useful character®
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+D800]U+D800 to
       [https://codepoints.net/U+DFFF]U+DFFF - surrogate code points. They
       are only reserved to ease
       [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16]UTF-16 encoding.
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+FEFF]U+FEFF ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE -
       it's name suggests, that it can be used like U+2060 WORD JOINER.
       And in fact the latter was introduced to inherit its semantics.
       This is because U+FEFF had become a special beacon called the
       [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark]byte order mark,
       that was placed on the beginning of some UTF-8 files. In complying
       software (including many text editors) this character is stripped
       from the start of a file and handled as metadata. In non-complying
       software (like the PHP interpreter) this leads to all sorts of fun
       behaviour.
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+FFFD]U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER - when
       a character cannot be displayed (e.g., decoding an erroneous UTF-8
       sequency), this code point steps into the breach.
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+1D455]U+1D455 is missing. It would be an
       italic small "h". It was not encoded, because it would be identical
       to the Planck constant h ([https://codepoints.net/U+210E]U+210E).

Code Points that Affect Others

     * [https://codepoints.net/U+202D]U+202D and
       [https://codepoints.net/U+202E]U+202E - change the text direction.
       Relevant XKCD:
       [https://xkcd.com/1137/]
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+FE0E]U+FE0E VARIATION SELECTOR-15 - force
       black-&-white emoji. If this code point follows an emoji, an
       explicit monochrome rendering of the emoji is requested (if the
       client supports it).
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+FE0F]U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR-16 - force
       colorful emoji. If this code point follows an emoji, an explicit
       colorful rendering of the emoji is requested (if the client
       supports it).
     * Diacritics and combining marks: There is a
       [https://codepoints.net/search?gc=Mn]host of characters, that add
       to the characters before. Those are called Combining Marks. Unicode
       provides a [http://unicode.org/faq/char_combmark.html]handy FAQ on
       the details, but in a nutshell: If you add one after a character,
       it is placed on top of that previous one. So, a + ° = å. This may
       lead to all kinds of funny problems, because for some combinations
       there are pre-composed characters. Our little å here can also be
       encoded as U+00E5. You might note, that while this has a length of
       one character, the combination of a and combining ring has a length
       of two characters.
       Of course, one can also do fun things with those characters like
       [http://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/113195]this answer on
       StackOverflow.
     * The [https://codepoints.net/U+1F1E6..U+1F1FF]Regional Indicator
       Symbols U+1F1E6 to U+1F1FF resemble the 26 latin characters. They
       are used to create flag emoji. Since the Unicode consortium didn't
       feel like getting on board with international politics, the
       solution to flags is to combine these 26 characters to the
       respective ISO code for a country. Examples:

       Country ISO Code    Code Points    Emoji (if supported)
       USA     US       U+1F1FA + U+1F1F8 º¸
       Germany DE       U+1F1E9 + U+0F1EA ©ª
       China   CN       U+1F1E8 + U+0F1F3 ¨³
     * Skin color of emoji: There are five code points, that control the
       skin color of emoji,
       [https://codepoints.net/U+1F3FB..U+1F3FF]U+1F3FB to U+1F3FF. They
       are called "Emoji Modifier Fitzpatrick Type" 1 to 6, with 1 the
       palest and 6 the darkest. If one of these characters follows an
       emoji, that emoji is meant to be rendered in the appropriate skin
       color of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzpatrick_scale]the
       Fitzpatrick scale. If no such modifier is added, the skin tone
       should be unnatural, e.g., bright yellow. Fun fact: Since the
       Fitzpatrick modifiers are normal code points, emoji with such skin
       colors have the length 2, which Twitter users noticed first. Here
       is a comparison chart
       [http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/tr51-2.html#Diversity]directly
       from the specification:

Breaking and Gluing other characters

     * [https://codepoints.net/U+00A0]U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE - force
       adjacent characters to stick together. Well known as &nbsp; in
       HTML.
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+00AD]U+00AD SOFT HYPHEN - (in HTML:
       &shy;) like ZERO WIDTH SPACE, but show a hyphen if (and only if) a
       break occurs.
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+200B]U+200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE - the
       inverse to U+00A0: create no space, but allow word breaking.
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+200D]U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER - force
       adjacent characters to be joined together (e.g., arabic characters
       or supported emoji). Apple uses this to compose some emoji like
       different families.
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+2060]U+2060 WORD JOINER - the same as
       U+00A0, but completely invisible. Good for writing @font-face on
       Twitter.

Record Holders and Extremes

     * [https://codepoints.net/U+0000]U+0000 <control> - first code point.
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+10FFFF]U+10FFFF (non-character) - last
       code point. The whole rest of its plane apart from U+10FFFE, the
       code points in the 0x10000-0x10FFFD range, are private use
       characters, guaranteed to be never filled by a future Unicode
       standard.
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+1F402]U+1F402 OX - shortest name.
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+FBF9]U+FBF9 ARABIC LIGATURE UIGHUR
       KIRGHIZ YEH WITH HAMZA ABOVE WITH ALEF MAKSURA ISOLATED FORM -
       longest name: 83 characters.
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+FDFA]U+FDFA ARABIC LIGATURE SALLALLAHOU
       ALAYHE WASALLAM - longest decomposition form: 18 characters.
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+5146]U+5146 and
       [https://codepoints.net/U+16B61]U+16B61 - code points that
       represent the highest "single-digit" number. In both cases that's
       1,000,000,000,000, a trillion.
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+0F33]U+0F33 TIBETAN DIGIT HALF ZERO -
       code point that represents the lowest "single-digit" number and at
       the same time the only negative one, -½.
     * The trophy for most useless code points goes to
       [https://codepoints.net/U+0080]U+0080,
       [https://codepoints.net/U+0081]U+0081 and
       [https://codepoints.net/U+0099]U+0099. These so-called C1 control
       characters are more or less unspecified. They got into Unicode,
       because they were present in the very first version of what should
       later become ISO 10646, the ISO-standardized version of Unicode.
       They
       [http://unicode.org/mail-arch/unicode-ml/y2015-m10/0050.html]were
       meant to be part of an upgrade to ISO 2022, that never came to be.
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+006F]U+006F LATIN SMALL LETTER O - leads
       the list of characters with confusable shapes. Of all the possible
       mappings in the
       [http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/#Data_Files]list of confusable
       characters, the small "o" leads with a whopping 73 entries of
       similar looking glyphs, followed by
       [https://codepoints.net/U+006C]U+006C LATIN SMALL LETTER L with 70
       entries.
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+1F4C0]U+1F4C0 DVD - only code point name
       without any vowel
       ([https://twitter.com/ken_lunde/status/960188623390846976]source)

For Funsies

     * [https://codepoints.net/U+1680]U+1680 OGHAM SPACE MARK - a space
       that looks like a dash. Great to bring programmers close to
       madness: 1 + 2 === 3.
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+037E]U+037E GREEK QUESTION MARK - a
       look-alike to the semicolon. Also a fun way to annoy developers.
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+1DD2]U+1DD2 COMBINING US ABOVE - this is
       the most romantic code point.
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+F8FF]U+F8FF PRIVATE USE CODEPOINT - this
       private use code point is rendered as Apple logo on many Apple
       devices.
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+1F574]U+1F574 MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT
       LEVITATING - A rather curious character, that only made it into
       Unicode for its appearance in the Webdings font (for reasons of
       backwards compatibility).
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+1F596]U+1F596 RAISED HAND WITH PART
       BETWEEN MIDDLE AND RING FINGERS - the Vulcan salute. Live long and
       prosper!
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+1F918]U+1F918 SIGN OF THE HORNS - Rock
       on!
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+2800]U+2800 BRAILLE PATTERN BLANK - A
       Braille pattern that has zero of its six or eight dots filled in.
       According to the standard: "* while this character is imaged as a
       fixed-width blank in many fonts, it does not act as a space"
       Essentially it is rendered as white-space, but since it is
       designated as not white-space it isn't matched by
       white-space-validating regular expressions. This can be used to
       bypass all kinds of validation that disallows or trims white-space.

Games

   For plain-text gaming, Unicode is well equipped with several complete
   sets:
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+2654..U+265F]Chess figures.
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+2660..U+2667]Card suits and even a whole
       [https://codepoints.net/playing_cards]deck of cards complete with
       joker and back of card.
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+2680..U+2685]Die faces and a nice
       [https://codepoints.net/U+1F3B2]die emoji.
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+2686..U+2689]Go pieces.
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+26C0..U+26C3]Draughts (or checkers)
       pieces.
     * [https://codepoints.net/U+2616,U+2617,U+26C9,U+26CA]Shogi pieces, a
       [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi]Japanese variant of chess.
