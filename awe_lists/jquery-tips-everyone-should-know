Use noConflict()

   The $ alias used by jQuery is also used by other JavaScript libraries.
   To ensure that jQuery doesn't conflict with the $ object of different
   libraries, use the noConflict() method at the start of the document:
jQuery.noConflict();

   Now you'll reference the jQuery object using the jQuery variable name
   instead of $ (e.g., jQuery('div p').hide()).

Checking If jQuery Loaded

   Before you can do anything with jQuery you first need to make certain
   it has loaded:
if (typeof jQuery == 'undefined') {
  console.log('jQuery hasn\'t loaded');
} else {
  console.log('jQuery has loaded');
}

   Now you're off...

   ^back to table of contents

Use .on() Binding Instead of .click()

   Using .on() gives you several advantages over using .click(), such as
   the ability to add multiple events...
.on('click tap hover')

   ...a binding applies to dynamically created elements, as well (there's
   no need to manually bind every single element dynamically added to a
   DOM element)...

   ...and the possibility to set a namespace:
.on('click.menuOpening')

   Namespaces give you the power to unbind a specific event (e.g.,
   .off('click.menuOpening')).

   yone-should-know#table-of-contents]back to table of contents

Back to Top Button

   By using the animate and scrollTop methods in jQuery you don't need a
   plugin to create a simple scroll-to-top animation:
// Back to top
$('.container').on('click', '.back-to-top', function (e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  $('html, body').animate({scrollTop: 0}, 800);
});

<!-- Create an anchor tag -->
<div class="container">
  <a href="#" class="back-to-top">Back to top</a>
</div>

   Changing the scrollTop value changes where you wants the scrollbar to
   land. All you're really doing is animating the body of the document
   throughout the course of 800 milliseconds until it scrolls to the top
   of the document.

   Note: Watch for some
   [https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/417]buggy behavior
   with scrollTop.

Preload Images

   If your web page uses a lot of images that aren't visible initially
   (e.g., on hover) it makes sense to preload them:
$.preloadImages = function () {
  for (var i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
    $('<img>').attr('src', arguments[i]);
  }
};

$.preloadImages('img/hover-on.png', 'img/hover-off.png');

   yone-should-know#table-of-contents]back to table of contents

Checking If Images Are Loaded

   Sometimes you might need to check if your images have fully loaded in
   order to continue on with your scripts:
$('img').on('load', function () {
  console.log('image load successful');
});

   You can also check if one particular image has loaded by replacing the
   <img> tag with an ID or class.

Fix Broken Images Automatically

   If you happen to find broken image links on your site replacing them
   one by one can be a pain. This simple piece of code can save a lot of
   headaches:
$('img').on('error', function () {
  if(!$(this).hasClass('broken-image')) {
    $(this).prop('src', 'img/broken.png').addClass('broken-image');
  }
});

   Alternatively, if you wish to simply hide broken images this snippet
   will take care of that for:
$('img').on('error', function () {
  $(this).hide();
});

   yone-should-know#table-of-contents]back to table of contents

Post a Form with AJAX

   jQuery AJAX methods are a common way to request text, HTML, XML, or
   JSON. If you wanted to send a form via AJAX you could collect the user
   inputs via the val() method:
$.post('sign_up.php', {
  user_name: $('input[name=user_name]').val(),
  email:     $('input[name=email]').val(),
  password:  $('input[name=password]').val(),
});

   However, all of those val() calls are expensive. A better way of
   collecting the user inputs is using the serialize() function which
   collects the user inputs as a string:
$.post('sign_up', $('#sign-up-form').serialize());

   ^back to table of contents

Toggle Classes on Hover

   Let's say you want to change the visual of a clickable element on your
   page when a user hovers over it. You can add a class to your element
   when the user is hovering; when the user stops hovering removes the
   class:
$('.btn').on('hover', function () {
  $(this).addClass('hover');
}, function () {
  $(this).removeClass('hover');
});

   You just need to add the necessary CSS. If you want an even simpler way
   use the toggleClass method:
$('.btn').on('hover', function () {
  $(this).toggleClass('hover');
});

   Note: CSS may be a faster solution in this case but it's still
   worthwhile to know this.

   ^back to table of contents

Disabling Input Fields

   At times you may want the submit button of a form or one of its text
   inputs to be disabled until the user has performed a certain action
   (e.g., checking the "I've read the terms" checkbox). Add the disabled
   attribute to your input so you can enable it when you want:
$('input[type="submit"]').prop('disabled', true);

   All you need to do is run the prop method again on the input, but set
   the value of disabled to false:
$('input[type="submit"]').prop('disabled', false);

   yone-should-know#table-of-contents]back to table of contents

Stop the Loading of Links

   Sometimes you don't want links to go to a certain web page nor reload
   the page; you might want them to do something else like trigger some
   other script. This will do the trick of preventing the default action:
$('a.no-link').on('click', function (e) {
  e.preventDefault();
});

   ^[file://localhost/Users/admin/Pros/sh/awesome/awe_raw/jquery-tips-ever
   yone-should-know#table-of-contents]back to table of contents

Cache jQuery Selectors

   Think of how many times you write the same selector over and over again
   in any project. Every $('.element') selector has to search the entire
   DOM each time, regardless if that selector had previously run. Instead,
   run the selector once and store the results in a variable:
var blocks = $('#blocks').find('li');

   Now you can use the blocks variable wherever you want without having to
   search the DOM every time:
$('#hideBlocks').on('click', function () {
  blocks.fadeOut();
});

$('#showBlocks').on('click', function () {
  blocks.fadeIn();
});

   Caching jQuery selectors are an easy performance gain.

   ^back to table of contents

Toggle Fade/Slide

   Sliding and fading are something we use plenty in our animations with
   jQuery. You might just want to show an element when a user clicks
   something, which makes the fadeIn and slideDown methods perfect. But if
   you want that element to appear on the first click and then disappear
   on the second this will work just fine:
// Fade
$('.btn').on('click', function () {
  $('.element').fadeToggle('slow');
});

// Toggle
$('.btn').on('click', function () {
  $('.element').slideToggle('slow');
});

Simple Accordion

   This is a simple method for a quick accordion:
// Close all panels
$('#accordion').find('.content').hide();

// Accordion
$('#accordion').find('.accordion-header').on('click', function () {
  var next = $(this).next();
  next.slideToggle('fast');
  $('.content').not(next).slideUp('fast');
  return false;
});

   By adding this script all you really needs to do on your web page is
   the necessary HTML go get this working.

   ^back to table of contents

Make Two Divs the Same Height

   Sometimes you'll want two divs to have the same height no matter what
   content they have in them:
$('.div').css('min-height', $('.main-div').height());

   This example sets the min-height which means that it can be bigger than
   the main div but never smaller. However, a more flexible method would
   be to loop over a set of elements and set the height to the height of
   the tallest element:
var $columns = $('.column');
var height = 0;
$columns.each(function () {
  if ($(this).height() > height) {
    height = $(this).height();
  }
});
$columns.height(height);

   If you want all columns to have the same height:
var $rows = $('.same-height-columns');
$rows.each(function () {
  $(this).find('.column').height($(this).height());
});

   Note: This can be done several ways
   [http://codepen.io/AllThingsSmitty/pen/KMPqoO]in CSS but depending on
   what your needs are, knowing how to do this in jQuery is still
   worthwhile.

Open External Links in New Tab/Window

   Open external links in a new browser tab or window and ensure links on
   the same origin open in the same tab or window:
$('a[href^="http"]').attr('target', '_blank');
$('a[href^="//"]').attr('target', '_blank');
$('a[href^="' + window.location.origin + '"]').attr('target', '_self');

   Note: window.location.origin doesn't work in IE10.
   [http://tosbourn.com/a-fix-for-window-location-origin-in-internet-explo
   rer/]This fix takes care of the issue.

Find Element By Text

   By using the contains() selector in jQuery you can find text in content
   of an element. If text doesn't exists, that element will be hidden:
var search = $('#search').val();
$('div:not(:contains("' + search + '"))').hide();

   ^back to table of contents

Trigger on Visibility Change

   Trigger JavaScript when the user is no longer focusing on a tab, or
   refocuses on a tab:
$(document).on('visibilitychange', function (e) {
  if (e.target.visibilityState === 'visible') {
    console.log('Tab is now in view!');
  } else if (e.target.visibilityState === 'hidden') {
    console.log('Tab is now hidden!');
  }
});

   yone-should-know#table-of-contents]back to table of contents

Ajax Call Error Handling

   When an Ajax call returns a 404 or 500 error the error handler will be
   executed. If the handler isn't defined, other jQuery code might not
   work anymore. Define a global Ajax error handler:
$(document).on('ajaxError', function (e, xhr, settings, error) {
  console.log(error);
});

   ^[file://localhost/Users/admin/Pros/sh/awesome/awe_raw/jquery-tips-ever
   yone-should-know#table-of-contents]back to table of contents

Chain Plugin Calls

   jQuery allows for the "chaining" of plugin method calls to mitigate the
   process of repeatedly querying the DOM and creating multiple jQuery
   objects. Let's say the following snippet represents your plugin method
   calls:
$('#elem').show();
$('#elem').html('bla');
$('#elem').otherStuff();

   This could be vastly improved by using chaining:
$('#elem')
  .show()
  .html('bla')
  .otherStuff();

   An alternative is to cache the element in a variable (prefixed with $):
var $elem = $('#elem');
$elem.hide();
$elem.html('bla');
$elem.otherStuff();

   Both chaining and
   [file://localhost/Users/admin/Pros/sh/awesome/awe_raw/jquery-tips-every
   one-should-know#cache-jquery-selectors]caching methods in jQuery are
   best practices that lead to shorter and faster code.

Sort List Items Alphabetically

   Let's say you end up with too many items in a list. Maybe the content
   is produced by a CMS and you want to order them alphabetically:
var ul = $('#list'),
lis = $('li', ul).get();

lis.sort(function (a, b) {
  return ($(a).text().toUpperCase() < $(b).text().toUpperCase()) ? -1 : 1;
});

ul.append(lis);

   There you go!

Disable Right-Click

   If you want to disable right-click, you can do it for an entire page...
$(document).ready(function () {
  $(document).bind('contextmenu', function (e) {
    return false;
  })
})

   ...but you can also do the same for a specific element:
$(document).ready(function () {
  $('#submit').bind('contextmenu', function (e) {
    return false;
  })
})
