     ¶ Curated list of Web Security materials and resources.

   Needless to say, most websites suffer from various types of bugs which
   may eventually lead to vulnerabilities. Why would this happen so often?
   There can be many factors involved including misconfiguration, shortage
   of engineers' security skills, etc. To combat this, here is a curated
   list of Web Security materials and resources for learning cutting edge
   penetrating techniques.

   Please read the
