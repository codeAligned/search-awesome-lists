GTD-Task Manager

   The GTD (Getting Things Done) method rests on the idea of moving
   planned tasks and projects out of the mind by recording them externally
   and then breaking them into actionable work items. This allows one to
   focus attention on taking action on tasks, instead of on recalling them
   ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done]Wikipedia). Tasks
   can be classified in contexts (@home, @computer, @office, etc), time of
   action (now, next actions, scheduled or someday) and projects.

   [http://gettingthingsdone.com/pdfs/tt_workflow_chart.pdf]here a
   flowchart.

       Store): Not so lightweight but still very good for managing life
       especially since it has got a lot of integrations from a lot of
