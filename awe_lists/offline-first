     Useful resources for creating Offline-First web apps

     "Web" and "online" are two closely associated terms, downright
     synonymous to many people. So why on earth would we talk about
     "offline" web technologies, and what does the term even mean?

W3C Specification

   [http://www.w3.org/TR/offline-webapps/]Offline Web Applications

     This specification highlights features (SQL, offline application
     caching APIs as well as online/offline events, status, and the
     localStorage API) from HTML5 and provides brief tutorials on how
     these features might be used to create Web applications that work
     offline.

   [http://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers/]Service Workers

     This specification describes a method that enables applications to
     take advantage of persistent background processing, including hooks
     to enable bootstrapping of web applications while offline.

   [http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/]IndexedDB

     This specification defines APIs for a database of records holding
     simple values and hierarchical objects. Each record consists of a
     key and some value. Moreover, the database maintains indexes over
     records it stores. An application developer directly uses an API to
     locate records either by their key or by using an index. A query
     language can be layered on this API. An indexed database can be
     implemented using a persistent B-tree data structure.

   [http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/]WebStorage

     This specification defines an API for persistent data storage of
     key-value pair data in Web clients.
