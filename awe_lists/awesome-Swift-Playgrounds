Contributing

   Please take a quick look at the
   [https://github.com/uraimo/awesome-swift-playgrounds/blob/master/CONTRI
   BUTING.md]contribution guidelines first. Thanks to all
   [https://github.com/uraimo/awesome-swift-playgrounds/graphs/contributor
   s]contributors; you rock!

   If you see a playground here that does not work anymore with the
   current release of Xcode or is not a good fit, please submit a pull
   request to improve this file or consider updating it, thank you!

Downloading all the playgrounds

   Unless otherwise indicated, all playgrounds are compatible with Swift
   3.

   All the playgrounds are available as submodules in the playgrounds/
   directory, to download them all in one go, just clone this repository
   with git clone --recursive
   https://github.com/uraimo/Awesome-Swift-Playgrounds.git or execute git
   submodule update --init after you have cloned the repository the usual
   way.

   Apple's playgrounds distributed as zip archives have to be downloaded
   manually.
