As Gitter's development seems to have slowed since their acquisition by GitLab we're moving our chat to Spectrum. It's a new product so still rough around the edges, but it's way more than a chat room which we think will be quite useful for the AVA community.

Come join us at [https://spectrum.chat/ava]https://spectrum.chat/ava!
