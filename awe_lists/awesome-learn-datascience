Awesome

   If you want to know more about Data Science but don't know where to
   start this list is for you!

   No previous knowledge required but Python and statistics basics will
   definitely come in handy. These ressources have been used successfully
   for many beginners at my local Data Science student group
   [http://ml-ka.de/]ML-KA.
