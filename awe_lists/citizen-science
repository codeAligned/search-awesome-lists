Digital Tools for Citizen Science

   Below is a curated list of awesome software and other resources to
   enable those who want to use scientific tools to empower communities
   and/or practice various forms of non-institutional science. It is
   largely inspired by
   [https://github.com/drewrwilson/toolsforactivism]this repository
   listing digital tools for activists. Feel free to share suggestions. If
   you add software to the list, free and open-source software is strongly
   encouraged over proprietary software.
