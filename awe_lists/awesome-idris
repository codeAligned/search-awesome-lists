     An auxiliary list of awesome [https://www.idris-lang.org/]Idris
     resources.

   Idris is a general purpose pure functional programming language with
   dependent types. Dependent types allow types to be predicated on
   values, meaning that some aspects of a program's behaviour can be
   specified precisely in the type. It is compiled, with eager evaluation.
   Its features are influenced by Haskell and ML.
