¿ Awesome Crypto Currency Tools & Algorithms

   [https://github.com/kennethreitz/awesome-coins]GitHub stars
   [https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome]Awesome
   [https://saythanks.io/to/kennethreitz]Say Thanks!

   From Wikipedia--

     A [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency]cryptocurrency is
     a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange using
     cryptography to secure the transactions and to control the creation
     of additional units of the currency.

   There are many algorithms used in many different crypto-currencies.
   This document serves to provide a simple map to reference which are for
   what, as well as provide a nice list of helpful services and utilities
   for managing coins.

So, Before We Begin...

   Some of this "coin" stuff may be confusing, if you're new. So, let me
   explain what I know so far --

   There are many, many [http://coinbin.org/coins]coins. People like to
   [https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Register?referrer=kennethreitz]trade them,
   not unlike stocks or Pokémon cards. People also like to
   [https://www.nicehash.com/?refby=386829]mine them, using their home
   computers or specialized hardware.

   Coins are stored in wallets. These can be hosted online, on your local
   computer, or even on a sheet of paper.

   It's hard to mine a coin on your own, and is a bit like gambling, so
   people usually opt to join a pool (which typically use the stratum
   protocol to coordinate) -- this rewards you for your work, even if you
   didn't find anything, because you helped contribute with thousands of
   other people, some of whom did find blocks. The blocks are then split
   up, based on the pool's rules.

   Some people [https://www.nicehash.com/?refby=386829]rent hashing power
   from farms and either play the "blockchain lottery", trying to find
   blocks of coins on their own, or they point the farm at a pool, like a
   typical home miner -- except they have a tremendously high amount of
   computational power available to them, if they're willing to pay for
   it.

   Hope that helps clear things up.
