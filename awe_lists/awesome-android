Development Alternatives

   My personal recommendation is (for now) to use the android api to build
   a native app. Scala can help to build this native apps with cleaner
   code but it adds to many methods (Multidex required). Kotlin is a
   modern language with 100% interoperatibility with java projects without
   multidex. But there are also use cases where alternatives like
   cross-platform development can be useful.
