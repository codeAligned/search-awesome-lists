Awesome MQTT

   [https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome]Awesome

     A curated list of MQTT related stuff.

   protocol, optimized for high-latency or unreliable networks. This
   protocol is a good choice for Internet of Things applications,
   Telemetry, Sensor Networks, Smart Metering, Home Automation, Messaging
   and Notification Services.
