readme.md

Awesome

   [https://www.npmjs.com/package/maintenance-modules]NPM

   There is no code in this module, the only thing is this README file.

   This is a list of modules that are useful for maintaining or developing
   modules (in no particular order).

henrikjoreteg

   A package.json file scrubber for the truly insane. Cleans up your
   package.json in a deterministic way to ensure high quality,
   handcrafted, artisinal JSON.
npm i fixpack --save-dev

feross

   JavaScript standard style checker/linter. No options allowed! Uses
   non-configurable opinionated settings to minimize bikeshedding. Never
   give style feedback on a pull request again!
npm i standard --save-dev

maxogden

   Checks which modules you have used in your code and then makes sure
   they are listed as dependencies in your package.json (or vice versa).
npm i dependency-check --save-dev

finnp

   Helper tool for the usual steps to create a module. Creates empty
   github repo, generates module boilerplate, runs npm init, does first
   commit + push, etc.
npm i create-module --save-dev

finnp

   A command line module for travis, especially targeted for managing
   tests for node modules. Helps you quickly add a travis hook + generate
   a travis badge for your readme.
npm i travisjs --save-dev

meandave

   Deploy to gh-pages with one command. Lets you add static build settings
   into your package.json and then automatically build, deploy and push to
   gh-pages from master using this module.
npm i gh-pages-deploy --save-dev

phuu

   Tiny tool for releasing npm modules. Bumps, commits, tags, pushes and
   publishes.
npm i npm-release --save-dev

tjunnone

   Find newer versions of dependencies than what your package.json allows.
npm i npm-check-updates --save-dev

zeke

   Node Package Editor: a CLI for one-off inspection and editing of
   properties in package.json files. Lets you avoid having to hand-edit
   JSON.
npm i npe -g

zeke

   Generate a README.md from package.json contents. With npm modules, lots
   of info can be gleaned from properties in the package.json file: name,
   description, scripts.test, preferGlobal, etc. That's why
   package-json-to-readme exists. Use it to generate a decent boilerplate
   README, then iterate from there.
npm i package-json-to-readme -g

zeke

   Open the npm package URL in your browser that matches your shell's
   current working directory.
npm i npmwd -g

twolfson

   Release manager for npm, bower, component, PyPI, git tags, and any
   plugin you can write. Publish to multiple package repositories at once.
npm i foundry --save-dev

boennemann

   Fully automate your package's releases. This will determine not only
   which version to release, but also when - all without you having to
   care about it ever again. The goal of this package is to remove humans
   from version numbers and releases. Check out the readme for more info!
npm i semantic-release --save-dev

maxogden

   Easily add new collaborators to your github repos + npm packages from
   the CLI, and then generate a collaborators.md file with the newly
   updated list of collaborators. Use this to add new maintainers to your
   projects.
npm i collaborator -g

mafintosh

   Preconfigured pipelines for node.js. A more powerful version of npm
   scripts, but less frameworky than gulp or grunt. Useful for when you
   might use Makefiles or bash scripts but want your pipelines to be cross
   platform.
npm i gasket --save-dev

ngoldman

   Command-line tool to quickly create a new node module with readme,
   license, contributing guidelines, and other goodies.
npm i module-init -g

ngoldman

   Create a release for a node package on GitHub. Uses the Github Releases
   API to create a new release. Defaults to using information from
   package.json and CHANGELOG.md.
npm i gh-release -g

sindresorhus

   JavaScript happiness style linter. Enforce strict code style. No
   decision-making. No config. It just works!
npm i xo -g

sindresorhus

   A better npm publish. Runs your tests before publishing, bumps version,
   pushes git commits/tags, and more.
npm i np -g

maintenance bash scripts

alias patch='pre-version && npm version patch && post-version'
alias minor='pre-version && npm version minor && post-version'
alias major='pre-version && npm version major && post-version'
alias pre-version='git diff --exit-code && npm prune && npm install -q && npm test'
alias post-version='npm run --if-present build && git diff --exit-code && git push && git push --tags && npm publish'
