     A curated list of GitHub's awesomeness

   just have a look at the
   contribution guidelines.

   The awesomeness is currently organized into just a few different
   buckets:

     * Novel uses of GitHub

   What is the [https://github.com/phillipadsmith/awesome-github]Awesome
   GitHub list? It's a collection of things that make GitHub one of the
   most amazing co-creation platforms in the world.

   It is specifically focused on GitHub, and not on
   [https://git-scm.com/]Git. Git is indeed awesome. And there would be no
   GitHub without Git. And yet, GitHub has become much more than a home to
   much of humanity's open-source code; it has become one of the world's
   most vivid examples of the power of mass collaboration.

   All that to say, this list --
   [https://github.com/phillipadsmith/awesome-github]Awesome GitHub -- is
   an attempt to document that aspect of what is awesome: everything that
   GitHub has become -- far beyond what Git is today, and beyond where
   GitHub started just eight years ago.

   The inspiration for this list came from
   [http://phillipadsmith.com/2015/09/github-gitdown.html]a session
   proposal for the [https://2015.mozillafestival.org/]2015 Mozilla
   Festival. I later learned, serendiptiously, that the Mozilla Festival
   itself was using [https://github.com/mozilla/mozfest-program]GitHub
   issues to manage the program -- reviewing proposals, assign sessions to
   tracks and themes, and much more. Just one more example of how GitHub
   is being used to make awesome.
