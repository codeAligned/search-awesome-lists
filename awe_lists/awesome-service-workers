   A curated collection of service worker resources.

   [https://pwabook.com/oreillyasw]Building Progressive Web Apps

     Service workers are at the heart of every progressive web app. Their
     persistent nature allows progressive web apps to fulfill our
     expectations of what an app should do. They are the missing link
     between what only native apps could do and what modern progressive
     web apps can do.

     * [https://developers.google.com/web/showcase/2016/service-worker-per
       f]Measuring the Real-world Performance Impact of Service Workers -
       One of the most significant benefits of service workers (from a
       performance perspective, at least) is their ability to proactively
       control the caching of assets. A web application that can cache all
       of its necessary resources should load substantially faster for
       returning visitors. But what do these gains actually look like to
       real users? And how do you even measure this?
