Awesome

     Curated list of projects that build non-financial applications of
     blockchain.

   The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic
   transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial
   transactions but virtually everything of value (by
   [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/whats-next-generation-internet-surprise
   -its-all-don-tapscott]Don Tapscott).

   Most applications of blockchain lie in a financial realm. That makes
   non-financial applications even more intriguing.

   Industry of a blockchain application is defined by the one that is
   changed the most. For example, discontinued IoT bitcoin micropayments
   startup [https://21.co/]21 (now [https://earn.com/]Earn.com) could
   significantly change both IoT and Financial sectors. Financial industry
   would expand its current practice to a new domain. For IoT, however,
   business model would change significantly. That intuition commands
   current classification.
