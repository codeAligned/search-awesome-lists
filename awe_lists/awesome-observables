Awesome

     An [https://github.com/zenparsing/es-observable]Observable is a
     collection that arrives over time. Observables can be used to model
     push-based data sources such as events, timer intervals,
     asynchronous requests, and animations. Observables can be
     transformed, combined, and consumed using array-like methods.
