     Tools to help prioritize above-the-fold CSS

Prioritize above-the-fold content first.

   For best performance, PageSpeed Insights
   [https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/PrioritizeVisibleCon
   tent]recommends inlining the critical (above-the-fold) CSS of your page
   directly into your HTML. This eliminates additional roundtrips and
   allows the browser to paint the above-fold experience to your user's
   screen sooner. The main idea is:
     * Determine the above-the-fold styles for a page and write them
       between <style> tags in the head.
     * Load all other stylesheets in the footer, ideally asynchronously.

   The following is a list of tools to help generate, inline and report on
   critical-path CSS.

Node modules

     * [https://github.com/pocketjoso/penthouse]Penthouse - by Jonas
       Ohlsson generates critical-path CSS
     * [https://github.com/addyosmani/critical]Critical - by Addy Osmani
       generates & inlines critical-path CSS (uses Penthouse,
       [https://github.com/addyosmani/oust]Oust and inline-styles)
     * [https://github.com/filamentgroup/criticalcss]CriticalCSS - by
       FilamentGroup finds & outputs critical CSS

Server-side modules

     * [https://github.com/pagespeed/mod_pagespeed]mod_pagespeed - Apache
       module for automatic PageSpeed optimization
     * [https://github.com/pagespeed/ngx_pagespeed]ngx_pagespeed - Nginx
       module for automatic PageSpeed optimization

Grunt tasks

     * [https://github.com/fatso83/grunt-penthouse]grunt-penthouse
     * [https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunt-criticalcss]grunt-critical-
       css
     * [https://github.com/bezoerb/grunt-critical]grunt-critical

CasperJS

     * [https://github.com/ibrennan/critical-css-casperjs]critical-css-cas
       perjs - CasperJS script to pull critical CSS information from pages

PhantomJS

     * [https://github.com/drdk/dr-css-inliner]dr-css-inliner - PhantomJS
       script to inline above-the-fold CSS on a page.

Inline sources (styles, scripts)

     * [https://github.com/maxogden/inline-styles]inline-styles - by Max
       Ogden, replaces <link> tags with inline <style> tags + inlines CSS
       url() calls with data URIs
     * [https://github.com/fmal/gulp-inline-source]gulp-inline-source - by
       Filip Malinowski, replaces <link> tags with inline <style> tags,
       and replaces <script src=""> tags with their inline content
     * [https://github.com/bezoerb/inline-critical]inline-critical - by
       Ben Zörb, inline critical path CSS and load existing stylesheets
       with loadCSS
     * [https://github.com/kriasoft/isomorphic-style-loader/]isomorphic-st
       yle-loader for Webpack - allows to extract critical CSS for any
       given page/screen in React apps and inline it into HTML during
       server-side rendering (SSR). See
       [https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit]React Starter Kit as
       an example.

Async load CSS

   Async loading should be used to fetch the rest of your site-wide styles
   after you've inlined your critical-path CSS.
     * [https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS]loadCSS - loads CSS
       asynchronously using JS.
       [https://gist.github.com/scottjehl/87176715419617ae6994]Research
       that led to this is also available.
     * [https://gist.github.com/matt-bailey/602b40c77a5d3381ff26]async &
       conditional loading - POC script for loading CSS files
       asynchronously and conditionally based on body tag classes
     * [https://github.com/n0mad01/asyncLoader]asyncLoader - async
       script/stylesheet loader
     * [http://addyosmani.github.io/basket.js/]basket.js - async
       script/resource loader with support for localStorage caching. Can
       be [https://github.com/andrewwakeling/basket-css-example]extended
       to load stylesheets.

   Note: The Guardian currently also cache their global styles into
   localStorage for subsequent page loads. More info in this
