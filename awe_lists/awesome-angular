Features

Directives

   Directives allow you to attach behavior to elements in the DOM.

Components

   A component is a directive which uses shadow DOM to create encapsulate
   visual behavior. Components are typically used to create UI widgets or
   to break up the application into smaller components.

View

   A View is a core primitive used by angular to render the DOM tree.

Templates

   Templates are markup which is added to HTML to declaratively describe
   how the application model should be projected to DOM as well as which
   DOM events should invoke which methods on the controller.

Change detection

   Every component gets a change detector responsible for checking the
   bindings defined in its template.

Dependency Injection

   Angular 1.x has two APIs for injecting dependencies into a directive.
   Angular 2 unifies the two APIs, making the code easier to understand
   and test.

Pipes

   Pipes can be appended on the end of the expressions to translate the
   value to a different format.

Web Workers

   WebWorker support in Angular is designed to make it easy to leverage
   parallelization in your web application. When you choose to run your
   application in a WebWorker angular runs both your application's logic
   and the majority of the core angular framework in a WebWorker.

HTTP

   Http is available as an injectable class, with methods to perform http
   requests. Calling request returns an EventEmitter which will emit a
   single Response when a response is received.

Angular 2 in Haxe

     Haxe is an open source toolkit based on a modern, high level,
     strictly typed programming language, a cross-compiler, a complete
     cross-platform standard library and ways to access each platform's
     native capabilities. General purpose language, with Haxe, you can
     easily build cross-platform tools targeting all the mainstream
     platforms natively. "Write once compile anywhere", with strong
     easily extendable macro system and powerfull, highly optimizing
     compiler with DCE (and f.e. using inline constructors). Can be used
     for server side rendering and in isomorphic way - possible to share
     the same source code compiling into client side in javascript and
     server side in pyhton (or java/php/node - can be choosen
     later/changed at scaling). Haxe code can contain (inline) any target
     language fragments (can be used to step by step porting), the
     externs mechanism provides access to the native APIs and libraries
     in a type-safe manner. Server, client, mobile (Android and iOS at
     once), desktop, embedded (Raspbery, award winning TIVO set top
     boxes), Playstation ... all can be reached natively with much less
     typing, more error-proof, more stable and compile-time type checked
     code even for non type-safe targets (f.e. JavaScript, PHP)!

Angular 2 components with Bit

     Bit is an open source virtual repository (code base) built to make
     components easily manageable and usable across applications. You can
     quickly export any Angular component from any context while working
     on any project to a bit distributed Scope. Bit's reusbale component
     environment cuts the overhead of configuring build and test
     environments for exporting every new component. The Scope is a
     virtual component repository which stores, organizes, manages and
     tests your components. Once modeled on a Scope, your components can
     be easily found and used in any Angular application. Components can
     be organized together and still modified and used individually
     without pulling in entire libraries.
