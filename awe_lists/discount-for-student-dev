README.md

Awesome

   This is list of discounts on software (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, etc.) and
   other offerings for developers who happen to be students. This list is
   greatly inspired by the
   [https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev]free-for-dev list.

   You can help by sending Pull Requests to add more services. Please read
   the
   [file://localhost/AchoArnold/discount-for-student-dev/blob/master/contr
   ibuting.md]contribution guidelines first. Once I have a good set of
   links in this README file, I'll look into a better layout for the
   information and links (help with that is appreciated too).

   If you're not inclined to make PRs you can tweet me at
