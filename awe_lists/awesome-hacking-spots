     Q: What makes a hacking spot awesome?

   A place where you would go and take your friends to go hacking with,
   power and wifi are a plus, having coffee and snacks is a bonus. We are
   excluding for now places that require a subscription or membership of
   somekind (unless that membership can be done at the of the visit moment
   and it doesn't require a long term commitment).

Lithuania ±¹

Vilnius

     There are plenty of "Caffeine" branded cafes around that have pretty
     good wifi and service. English speakers are hit and miss, be
     prepared for a lot of random pointing and confusion. If you're
     paying with a credit card, expect people freaking out about what to
     do with a receipt that requires signing (no POS systems here support
     PINs).

Knygynas DRAUGYSTE

     A cafe connected to a bookshop. Very tolerant of hacker types who
     never leave. Wifi is about 8mbit, and fairly stable. Most speak
     enough English you can order a coffee, and the coffee is good. Cow
     milk only.

     In general, you can go to any Wayne's Coffee or Espresso House to

     spotty compared with the Espresso Houses that I tried, and Espresso
     House often caters for laptop users with power points under chairs
     or near tables.
