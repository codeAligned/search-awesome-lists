About

   Less is a open source dynamic style sheet language that can be compiled
   into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and run on the client side or server
   side. Designed by Alexis Sellier, Less is influenced by Sass and has
   influenced the newer "SCSS" syntax of Sass, which adapted its CSS-like
   block formatting syntax. Less provides the following mechanisms:
   variables, nesting, mixins, operators and functions; the main
   difference between Less and other CSS precompilers being that Less
   allows real-time compilation via Less by the browser. Font:
