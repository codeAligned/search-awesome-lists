Awesome

     A curated list of awesome libraries and components for ActionScript
     3 and Adobe AIR.

   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_AIR]Adobe AIR provides a single
   set of APIs to build cross-platform desktop/mobile applications and
   games. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript]ActionScript 3 is
   the programming language for AIR. Powerful native functionality such as
   file system, SQLite, sensors are included by default. To add missing
   functionality, you can build ANEs (Air Native Extensions) coded in the
   native language (eg VC++ for Windows, Java for Android,
   Swift/Objective-C for iOS). To build mobile apps/games with
   GPU-rendered graphics, use the [https://gamua.com/starling/]Starling
   framework and optionally the [https://feathersui.com/]Feathers UI.
   Adobe AIR is very popular in the mobile gaming space.

   Contributions welcome. To add a useful project simply create an
