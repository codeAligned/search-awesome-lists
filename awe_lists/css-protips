Use a CSS Reset

   CSS resets help enforce style consistency across different browsers
   with a clean slate for styling elements. You can use a CSS reset
   library like [http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/]Normalize, et
   al., or you can use a more simplified reset approach:
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

   Now elements will be stripped of margins and padding, and box-sizing
   lets you manage layouts with the CSS box model.

Demo

   Note: If you follow the
   Inherit box-sizing tip below you might opt to not include
   the box-sizing property in your CSS reset.

   ^back to table of contents

Inherit box-sizing

   Let box-sizing be inherited from html:
html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

*, *::before, *::after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}

   This makes it easier to change box-sizing in plugins or other
   components that leverage other behavior.

Use :not() to Apply/Unapply Borders on Navigation

   Instead of putting on the border...
/* add border */
.nav li {
  border-right: 1px solid #666;
}

   ...and then taking it off the last element...
/* remove border */
.nav li:last-child {
  border-right: none;
}

   ...use the :not() pseudo-class to only apply to the elements you want:
.nav li:not(:last-child) {
  border-right: 1px solid #666;
}

   Sure, you can use .nav li + li or even .nav li:first-child ~ li, but
   with :not() the intent is very clear and the CSS selector defines the
   border the way a human would describe it.

Demo

Add line-height to body

   You don't need to add line-height to each <p>, <h*>, et al. separately.
   Instead, add it to body:
body {
  line-height: 1.5;
}

   This way textual elements can inherit from body easily.

Demo

   ^back to table of contents

Vertically-Center Anything

   No, it's not black magic, you really can center elements vertically:
html, body {
  height: 100%;
  margin: 0;
}

body {
  -webkit-align-items: center;
  -ms-flex-align: center;
  align-items: center;
  display: -webkit-flex;
  display: flex;
}

   Want to center something else? Vertically, horizontally...anything,
   anytime, anywhere? CSS-Tricks has
   [https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/]a nice write-up
   on doing all of that.

   Note: Watch for some
   [https://github.com/philipwalton/flexbugs#3-min-height-on-a-flex-contai
   ner-wont-apply-to-its-flex-items]buggy behavior with flexbox in IE11.

Demo

   ^back to table of contents

Comma-Separated Lists

   Make list items look like a real, comma-separated list:
ul > li:not(:last-child)::after {
  content: ",";
}

   Use the :not() pseudo-class so no comma is added to the last item.

   Note: This tip may not be ideal for accessibility, specifically screen
   readers. And copy/paste from the browser doesn't work with
   CSS-generated content. Proceed with caution.

   ^back to table of contents

Select Items Using Negative nth-child

   Use negative nth-child in CSS to select items 1 through n.
li {
  display: none;
}

/* select items 1 through 3 and display them */
li:nth-child(-n+3) {
  display: block;
}

   Or, since you've already learned a little about
   using :not(), try:
/* select all items except the first 3 and display them */
li:not(:nth-child(-n+3)) {
  display: none;
}

   Well that was pretty easy.

Demo

Use SVG for Icons

   There's no reason not to use SVG for icons:
.logo {
  background: url("logo.svg");
}

   SVG scales well for all resolution types and is supported in all
   browsers [http://caniuse.com/#search=svg]back to IE9. So ditch your
   .png, .jpg, or .gif-jif-whatev files.

   Note: If you have SVG icon-only buttons for sighted users and the SVG
   fails to load, this will help maintain accessibility:
.no-svg .icon-only::after {
  content: attr(aria-label);
}

   e-of-contents]back to table of contents

Use the "Lobotomized Owl" Selector

   It may have a strange name but using the universal selector (*) with
   the adjacent sibling selector (+) can provide a powerful CSS
   capability:
* + * {
  margin-top: 1.5em;
}

   In this example, all elements in the flow of the document that follow
   other elements will receive margin-top: 1.5em.

   For more on the "lobotomized owl" selector, read
   [http://alistapart.com/article/axiomatic-css-and-lobotomized-owls]Heydo
   n Pickering's post on A List Apart.

Demo

Use max-height for Pure CSS Sliders

   Implement CSS-only sliders using max-height with overflow hidden:
.slider {
  max-height: 200px;
  overflow-y: hidden;
  width: 300px;
}

.slider:hover {
  max-height: 600px;
  overflow-y: scroll;
}

   The element expands to the max-height value on hover and the slider
   displays as a result of the overflow.

   ^back to table of contents

Equal-Width Table Cells

   Tables can be a pain to work with so try using table-layout: fixed to
   keep cells at equal width:
.calendar {
  table-layout: fixed;
}

   Pain-free table layouts.

Demo

Get Rid of Margin Hacks With Flexbox

   When working with column gutters you can get rid of nth-, first-, and
   last-child hacks by using flexbox's space-between property:
.list {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.list .person {
  flex-basis: 23%;
}

   Now column gutters always appear evenly-spaced.

   ^[file://localhost/Users/admin/Pros/sh/awesome/awe_raw/css-protips#tabl
   e-of-contents]back to table of contents

Use Attribute Selectors with Empty Links

   Display links when the <a> element has no text value but the href
   attribute has a link:
a[href^="http"]:empty::before {
  content: attr(href);
}

   That's pretty convenient.

Demo

   ^back to table of contents

Style "Default" Links

   Add a style for "default" links:
a[href]:not([class]) {
  color: #008000;
  text-decoration: underline;
}

   Now links that are inserted via a CMS, which don't usually have a class
   attribute, will have a distinction without generically affecting the
   cascade.

   ^[file://localhost/Users/admin/Pros/sh/awesome/awe_raw/css-protips#tabl
   e-of-contents]back to table of contents

Consistent Vertical Rhythm

   Use a universal selector (*) within an element to create a consistent
   vertical rhythm:
.intro > * {
  margin-bottom: 1.25rem;
}

   Consistent vertical rhythm provides a visual aesthetic that makes
   content far more readable.

   ^[file://localhost/Users/admin/Pros/sh/awesome/awe_raw/css-protips#tabl
   e-of-contents]back to table of contents

Intrinsic Ratio Boxes

   To create a box with an intrinsic ratio, all you need to do is apply
   top or bottom padding to a div:
.container {
  height: 0;
  padding-bottom: 20%;
  position: relative;
}

.container div {
  border: 2px dashed #ddd;
  height: 100%;
  left: 0;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  width: 100%;
}

   Using 20% for padding makes the height of the box equal to 20% of its
   width. No matter the width of the viewport, the child div will keep its
   aspect ratio (100% / 20% = 5:1).

Demo

   e-of-contents]back to table of contents

Style Broken Images

   Make broken images more aesthetically-pleasing with a little bit of
   CSS:
img {
  display: block;
  font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  font-weight: 300;
  height: auto;
  line-height: 2;
  position: relative;
  text-align: center;
  width: 100%;
}

   Now add pseudo-elements rules to display a user message and URL
   reference of the broken image:
img::before {
  content: "We're sorry, the image below is broken :(";
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

img::after {
  content: "(url: " attr(src) ")";
  display: block;
  font-size: 12px;
}

   Learn more about styling for this pattern in
   [https://github.com/ireade/]Ire Aderinokun's
   [http://bitsofco.de/styling-broken-images/]original post.

Use rem for Global Sizing; Use em for Local Sizing

   After setting the base font size at the root (html { font-size: 100%;
   }), set the font size for textual elements to em:
h2 {
  font-size: 2em;
}

p {
  font-size: 1em;
}

   Then set the font-size for modules to rem:
article {
  font-size: 1.25rem;
}

aside .module {
  font-size: .9rem;
}

   Now each module becomes compartmentalized and easier to style, more
   maintainable, and flexible.

Hide Autoplay Videos That Aren't Muted

   This is a great trick for a custom user stylesheet. Avoid overloading a
   user with sound from a video that autoplays when the page is loaded. If
   the sound isn't muted, don't show the video:
video[autoplay]:not([muted]) {
  display: none;
}

   Once again, we're taking advantage of using the
   [file://localhost/Users/admin/Pros/sh/awesome/awe_raw/css-protips#use-n
   ot-to-applyunapply-borders-on-navigation]:not() pseudo-class.

   ^back to table of contents

Use :root for Flexible Type

   The type font size in a responsive layout should be able to adjust with
   each viewport. You can calculate the font size based on the viewport
   height and width using :root:
:root {
  font-size: calc(1vw + 1vh + .5vmin);
}

   Now you can utilize the root em unit based on the value calculated by
   :root:
body {
  font: 1rem/1.6 sans-serif;
}

Demo

Set font-size on Form Elements for a Better Mobile Experience

   To avoid mobile browsers (iOS Safari, et al.) from zooming in on HTML
   form elements when a <select> drop-down is tapped, add font-size to the
   selector rule:
input[type="text"],
input[type="number"],
select,
textarea {
  font-size: 16px;
}
