Awesome

   A curated list of good design and experience principles.

     Design Principles are a tool for creating better and more consistent
     designs and experiences. They are high level rules that guide
     detailed design decisions. They are often written down within bigger
     style guides, pattern libraries or design systems.

Credits and Notes

   This list is heavily inspired by
   [https://github.com/alexpate/awesome-design-systems]Awesome Design
   Systems by Alex Pate. As an UX designer I find myself writing design
   and/or experience principles quite often. I created this list for
   reference and to get inspiration for better design principles.
