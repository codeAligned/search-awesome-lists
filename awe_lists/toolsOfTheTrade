Background

   In 2010, Joshua Schachter, the founder of Delicious,
   [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1769910]posted the following on
   Hacker News:

     When I first started delicious, we had to host most of the services
     ourselves. CVS, mail, mailing lists, etc etc etc.

     These days, lots of that stuff is available as SaaS. What are the
     tools and services people use instead of hosting their own?

     (I'm not talking about actual production services like EC2 and
     Heroku and whatnot. We can go over this in another thread.)

   In 2013, Sharjeel Qureshi,
   [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5235137]posted the following:

     Few years ago, Joshua Schachter started this thread on HN for
     discussing hosted useful services:
     [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1769910]https://news.ycombinat
     or.com/item?id=1769910

     The contribution in thread introduced many interesting SaaS services
     which can immensely help in deploying services as well as
     development.

     It's been three years since then. What do we have today?

   Many thanks to the big contributors to the previous threads, including
   garrettdimon, espeed, netshade, and cmadan, and many more that I
   haven't named.

Now

   I've collected more data from Hacker News, AngelList and Quora, to make
   the 2015 (and hopefully beyond) version. This list also includes
   self-hosted as well as hosted services.

   It's hosted on GitHub for a reason! Please submit pull requests.

       Project visibility | In LeanKit, you map your organization's
       processes onto virtual whiteboards. On each board the process steps
       are represented as vertical and horizontal lanes. Cards represent
       work items, which team members update and move from across the
       board as they complete their share of the work. Rather than having
       to ask for status reports, managers and customers can just look at
       the board. Board updates are visible in seconds around the globe
       and e-mail alerts and RSS feeds are available, so you and your team
       can take immediate action to resolve issues before they turn into
       serious problems.

       background every few minutes to move and manage data on your
       behalf. Only live Zaps count against your limit -- you can have as
       many paused and unfinished Zaps as you'd like. For example, one Zap
       might be "Send me an SMS every time I get a new email".
