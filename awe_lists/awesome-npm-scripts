Cross-platform Shell Reference

   A quick reference of the shell operators & commands that work the same
   on Unix and Windows.
     * && runs commands in sequence. If a command fails, the script exits.
     * | pipes the stdout of one command into the stdin of the next.
       (do-something | something else)
     * > writes the stdout of a command to a file. (do-something > file)
     * < sends the contents of a file to a command's stdin. (command <
       file)
     * cd <dir> changes the current working directory to <dir>. Note that
       cd alone prints the current working directory on windows, but
       changes the working directory to ~ on *nix.

npm run Reference

   You can use npm run-script or npm run; they both do the same thing, but
   npm run is shorter.
     * Run just npm run to print a list of scripts.
     * Running npm run script (where script is the name of your script)
       will run prescript, script, and postscript; in that order.
          + You can't nest pre and post hooks (i.e. preprescript won't
            work).
     * You can pass arguments to your scripts by passing -- to npm run,
       followed by the arguments. Example: Given the script "mocha":
       "mocha", you can run npm run mocha -- --reporter xunit. This
       effectively runs mocha --reporter xunit.
     * Running npm test is the same as running npm run test. The same
       applies to npm start and npm stop.
     * You can run npm run <script> -s to silence the default npm output
       (useful for calling a script within another script).
